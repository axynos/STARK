## Source Audio Mixer and TTS

## [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/axynos/STARK/releases/latest)

STARK is an application that allows you to read commands from Source games and playback audio files, or use Text-to-Speech.
This is a project that evolved from a proof-of-concept I made a while ago using AutoHotKey [link](https://github.com/axynos/CSGO-Text-To-Speech).
