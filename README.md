## [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/axynos/STARK/releases/latest)

STARK is an application that allows you to use Text-to-Speech and play back audio through your mic in Source engine games using in-game chat commands.

### Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, don't. The code is being rewritten for v2 and is not ready for public use. So if you really want to contribute, wait until the v2 release.
